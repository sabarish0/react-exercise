    <h1>ABOUT PHOTOGRAPHY</h1>
    <h4>Photography is the art of capturing light with a camera,<br/>usually via a digital sensor or film, to create an image.
    With <br/> the right camera equipment, you can even photograph<br/>wavelengths of light invisible to the human eye, including<br/>
    UV, infrared, and radio.The first permanent photograph was<br/>captured in 1826 (some sources say 1827) by Joseph<br/>Nicéphore
    Niépce in France. It shows the roof of a building<br/> lit by the sun.</h4>
